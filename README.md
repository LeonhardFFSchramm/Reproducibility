# Reproducibility Checks/Tests
This repository aims to provide materials and information to facilitate and improve reproducibility checks (checking whether and how easily analyses of a scientific paper can be reproduced using the same data). It contains the following documents:
- **Manual_Researchers_Repro-Test.md**: This file aims to provide reseachers with some central steps to a) make sure that the reproducibility test can be conducted completely by an independent reproducer (who does not know anything about project/data) and b) guarantee some minimal standards which will help to make the reproducibility attempt as successful as possible.
- **Manual_Reproducer_Repro-Test.md**: This file aims to provide possible reproducer (people who check the reproducibility of a paper's analyses) with instructions on how to conduct a reproducibility check, This includes checking a) the general reproduction of the authors' analyses and b) the reusability of the files (scripts, data) within the research project.
- **Repro_Check_Report.pdf**: This document can be used alongside the **Manual_Reproducer_Repro-Test.md** to document the results of the reproducibilty check in a structured report document.

Feel free to contact us if you think something is missing within the manuals or the report document!
